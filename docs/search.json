    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Some adolescents exhibit resilience even in the face of high levels of stress exposure. Despite this relationship, studies that investigate explanations for how resilience interacts with risk to produce particular outcomes and why this is so are lacking. The effect of resilience across the relationship between stress and symptoms of anxiety and stress and symptoms of depression was tested to provide explanations for how resilience interacts with stress and symptoms of anxiety, and depression.\nMethod In a cross-sectional survey, 533 Ghanaian adolescents aged 13–17 years (M=15.25, SD=1.52), comprising 290 girls and 237 boys completed the Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Adolescent Stress Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, and Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted.\nResults The results indicated that resilience partially mediated the relationship between stress, and symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Effects of stress were negatively associated with resilience, and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. In a differential moderator effect, resilience moderated the relationship between stress and symptoms of depression but not stress and symptoms of anxiety.\nLimitations Although the findings in this study are novel, they do not answer questions about protective mechanisms or processes.\nConclusions Evidence that resilience did not have the same effect across stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression may support resilience as a dynamic process model. Access to different levels of resilience shows that enhancing resilience while minimizing stress may improve psychiatric health in adolescents’ general population.\nDownload paper here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper analyzes the power relation between the interviewer and the interviewee in the qualitative research interview methodology. The paper sets out to grapple with the extent to which the dynamisms in power shifts influence data collection and analysis in the interview methodology. The exploration of power shifts in the qualitative research interview facilitates comprehensive understanding of the nuances of the data by providing more information about the interviewee and the interviewer. This enhances a deeper discerning into the research process, and the topics discussed. This paper also elaborates on how interviewees as well as interviewers display their countermeasures to each other in the course of the interview situation and presents a greater understanding of the power dynamics that exist between the interviewer and interviewee. Power asymmetry seems to be an exasperating circumstance in the interview methodology as pointed out by the discussions in this article. This article also discusses practical recommendations for minimizing the power dynamic s during data analysis in the qualitative research interview.\nDownload paper here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Rejecting the null hypothesis is useful for making inferences about the sample and the population because it allows the researcher to draw conclusions about whether or not there is a statistically significant effect, difference or relationship between variables.\nResearchers start their research by creating a null hypothesis, which is typically the assumption that there is no significant effect, difference or relationship between the variables. Researchers then collect data from a sample of the population and use statistical tests to determine whether the data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis, which typically states that there is a significant effect, difference or relationship between the variables.\nIf a researcher rejects the null hypothesis and accepts the alternative hypothesis, this means that the researcher can confidently conclude that there is a statistically significant effect, difference or relationship between the variables in the population from which the sample was drawn. Being able to make inferences about the population, even if the researcher only has data from a sample of that population, is because the researcher has determined that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance (through null hypothesis testing - see the previous post), and so the results are representative of the population as a whole. If you have read the previous post, you would know sampling error or random variability poses a problem to this claim"

    "section": "Example",
    "text": "Example\n\nLet’s say that a researcher starts with a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety, and collects data from 750 students of NTNU. If a correlation test shows a very low p-value, say p < 0.05, this means that it is very unlikely that the results of the correlation test could have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis was true. Since the p-value, or the probability of observing the results given the null hypothesis, is less than the significance level, researchers reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis, which states that there is a significant relationship or effect between the variables being tested - that is, the observed relationship in the sample data reflects true effect or relationship in the population.\n\nBy rejecting the null hypothesis, the researcher can make the inference that attending lectures has an effect on exam anxiety in the population of all NTNU students from which the sample of 750 students was drawn. This is an inference because the researcher did not study the population of all NTNU students, but the correlation test on the sample of 750 has provided enough evidence to make a conclusion about the population of all NTNU students."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Resilience has provided a useful framework that elucidates the effects of protective factors to overcome psychological adversities but studies that address the potential contingencies of resilience to protect against direct and indirect negative effects are lacking. These obvious gaps have also resulted in oversimplification of complex processes that can be clarified by moderated mediation associations. This study examines a conditional process modelling of the protective effects of resilience against indirect effects.\nMethod Two separate samples were recruited in a cross-sectional survey from Australia and Norway to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire −9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Stressful Negative Life Events Questionnaire and the Resilience Scale for Adults. The final sample sizes were 206 (females = 114; males = 91; other = 1) and 210 (females = 155; males = 55) for Australia and Norway respectively. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted across the samples.\nResults Anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between exposure to stressful negative life events and depressive symptoms in both samples. Conditional indirect effects of exposure to stressful negative life events on depressive symptoms mediated by anxiety symptoms showed that high subgroup of resilience was associated with less effect of exposure to stressful negative life events through anxiety symptoms on depressive symptoms than the low subgroup of resilience.\nLimitations As a cross-sectional survey, the present study does not answer questions about causal processes despite the use of a conditional process modelling.\nConclusions These findings support that, resilience protective resources can protect against both direct and indirect – through other channels – psychological adversities.\nDownload paper here"
