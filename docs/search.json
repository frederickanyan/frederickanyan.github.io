Thus, this study goes beyond lumping together potential mediating and moderating processes that can explain the relations between stress and (symptoms of) psychopathology and the buffering effect of resilience.\nMethods Ghanaian adolescents between 13 and 17 years (female = 285; male = 244) completed the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire (ASQ), Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ). Independent samples t-test, multivariate analysis of covariance with follow-up tests and moderated mediation analyses were performed.\nResults Evidences were found for specificity in the associations between dimensions of adolescent stressors and depressive symptoms independent of transient anxiety. Transient anxiety partly accounted for the indirect effects of eight stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Except stress of school attendance and school/leisure conflict, resilience moderated the indirect effects of specific stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Results suggested differences in how Ghanaian adolescents view the various stress dimensions, and mediated pathways associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nLimitations Use of cross-sectional data does not show causal process and temporal changes over time.\nConclusions Findings support and clarify the specificity in the interrelations and mediated pathways among dimensions of adolescent stress, transient anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Conditional process analyses shows that resilience does not only buffer direct, but also indirect psychological adversities. Interventions for good mental health may focus on low resilience subgroups in specific stress dimensions while minimizing transient anxiety.\nRead more\nDownload"

The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention.\nMethods UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48 months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning.\nAmong the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods.\nDiscussion We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.\nRead more\nDownload"

The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) is one of the best psychometrically rated scales and has been validated among Norwegian samples. The purpose of this study was to explore the construct validity of the RSA in an English-speaking Australian sample and test measurement invariance between the Australian sample and a Norwegian sample. An Australian sample (N = 781) completed the RSA, Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7). A second sample of Norwegians (N = 320) was included in the analyses of invariance of the RSA across cultures. There were expected negative correlations between RSA and PHQ-9, and between RSA and GAD-7, but positive correlations between RSA and SOC-13. The results indicated that the six-factor measurement model of the RSA is the same in the Australian and Norwegian samples, and respondents from the two cultures understood and interpreted the items in a comparable fashion.

UPRIGHT implemented a co-creation research process whose results, outcomes and policy implications are presented here.

The results integrate quantitative and qualitative information to propose a regional adaptation strategy that prioritizes resilience skills, adolescents’ concerns, and preferred methods for implementation across countries and in each school community. In conclusion, a whole-school resilience program must innovate, include and connect different actors, services and communities, and must incorporate new technologies and activities outside the classroom.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Resilience is the ability of an individual or community to adapt to life challenges or adversities while maintaining mental health and well-being. In the multi-systemic resilience paradigm, human development and resilience is embedded in adaptive systems and in their interactions. Although the relationship between school systems and adolescents’ mental wellbeing is established, there is no agreement on how to recognize and evaluate the most relevant aspects of the school community, acting at collective level, to boost positive socio-emotional and educational outcomes in children and adolescents. This study presents the development and preliminary validation of a new and theory-driven construct and instrument, the School Resilience Scale for Adults (SRS). School Resilience comprises five interrelated constructs (i.e. Positive relationships, Belonging, Inclusion, Participation, and Mental health awareness) connected theoretically to wellbeing and resilience in children and adolescents. The scale development was theory-driven, and the instrument was tested in four European counties in the frame of the UPRIGHT project (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers). Overall, 340 adults participated, 129 teachers and school staff, and 211 relatives of teenagers. The sample was randomly split for two studies: (1) an Exploratory Factor analysis (ESEM), and (2) Confirmatory Factor (CFA) analysis. In the exploratory analysis, Chi-Square difference test and model fit indices point towards the five-factor solution over a three-factor solution. The confirmatory study indicated that a five-factor model (RMSEA = 0.038, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.045) was slightly better than a second-order model (RMSEA = 0.046, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, SRMR = 0.05). Convergent and discriminant validities were partially demonstrated. Alpha and omega reliability coefficients verified the measurement model of the scale. The results confirmed that a multidimensional construct of School Resilience, defined as a collective resilience factor, embedded in the school staff, family members, and adolescents’ interrelated systems can be characterized and measured. Further studies must determine its role in the promotion of adolescents’ resilience, mental wellbeing, educational outcomes, and in their positive adaptation in challenging contexts.\nRead more\nDownload"

A total of 244 boys and 285 girls aged 13–17 years recruited from Accra, Ghana completed the Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Stress of Home Life and Family Cohesion self-report scales in April 2015. In each sample, two mediation analyses were conducted using Structural Equation Modelling. Exposure to stress at home that was perceived to result from sociocultural prescriptions of gender role norms largely accounted for anxiety and depressive symptoms among girls, whereas this relation was non-significant among boys. Significant indirect relations through low family cohesion to anxiety symptoms were observed for girls and boys but not to depressive symptoms for boys. These findings suggest that differences in gender role socializations at home may account for individual differences in associations between exposure to stress at home and anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as explain the differential indirect relations through low family cohesion. Improving family cohesion while reducing stress at home may contribute to reducing stress and thus anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nRead more\nDownload"

These obvious gaps have also resulted in oversimplification of complex processes that can be clarified by moderated mediation associations. This study examines a conditional process modelling of the protective effects of resilience against indirect effects.\nMethod Two separate samples were recruited in a cross-sectional survey from Australia and Norway to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire −9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Stressful Negative Life Events Questionnaire and the Resilience Scale for Adults. The final sample sizes were 206 (females = 114; males = 91; other = 1) and 210 (females = 155; males = 55) for Australia and Norway respectively. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted across the samples.\nResults Anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between exposure to stressful negative life events and depressive symptoms in both samples. Conditional indirect effects of exposure to stressful negative life events on depressive symptoms mediated by anxiety symptoms showed that high subgroup of resilience was associated with less effect of exposure to stressful negative life events through anxiety symptoms on depressive symptoms than the low subgroup of resilience.\nLimitations As a cross-sectional survey, the present study does not answer questions about causal processes despite the use of a conditional process modelling.\nConclusions These findings support that, resilience protective resources can protect against both direct and indirect – through other channels – psychological adversities.\nRead more\nDownload"

The high resilience subgroup was less affected than the low resilience subgroup by the effect of stress exposure symptoms of depression, mediated by anxiety.

However, empirical exploration of prospective and reciprocal relations between worry and rumination are lacking. This study investigated the stability and relations between worry and rumination to better understand how they influence each other over time, and how different levels of metacognitive beliefs affect relations between (i) initial and future worry, and initial and future rumination, and (ii) the cross-lag relations between worry and rumination. Overall, 482 (Females = 63%) participants (Mean age = 26 years) participated in a two-wave data collection and completed the Metacognition Questionnaire (MCQ-30), the Ruminative Response Scale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). A multigroup two-wave autoregressive cross-lagged model was estimated. Multigroup autoregression analyses revealed that independent of participants being in the high or low metacognition group, initial levels of worry predicted future levels of worry, as was the case for rumination. Multigroup cross-lagged analyses revealed that initial levels of worry did not predict future levels of rumination in both high and low levels of metacognitions. However, initial rumination predicted future levels of worry in the high metacognitions group, which was not the case for the low metacognitions group. Thus, high levels of metacognitions do not only strengthen the relation between both present and future worry, present and future rumination, but also present rumination with future worry. This finding may imply that those with rumination related conditions at present are more likely in the future to show both rumination and worry related conditions. Conversely, those with worry related conditions show future worry related conditions. These findings may have implications for a clinical sample regarding the high complexity of rumination conditions that may proceed with multifinality causal pathways especially for individuals with high levels of metacognitions. This complexity may be a possible explanation for the limited success in other traditional treatment of rumination related conditions and the relatively high relapse rates for such conditions in clinical samples.\nRead more\nDownload"

Recently, it is emerging that anxiety precedes depression but not the reverse, and markedly increase in response to stress giving way to depression. As such, anxiety itself could be a predictive risk factor, and mediate the associations between stress and depression. While resilience protects against exposure to stress and common mental health problems, it is unclear to what extent different resilience factors are differentially involved in protection against anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study explored complex theoretical associations between interpersonal stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms and resilience factors.\nMaterials and methods Participants (N = 210 adults) completed the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Stressful Life Events Questionnaire (SLE) in a cross-sectional survey. Hierarchical linear regressions and moderated-mediation analyses were performed using PROCESS macro.\nResults Interpersonal stress explained more variance in depressive than anxiety symptoms. Support was found for the mediating effect of anxiety symptoms in the relationship between interpersonal stress and depressive symptoms. Resilience factors are differentially involved in protection against anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nConclusion Exposure to interpersonal stress is not only directly associated with depressive symptoms but also indirectly through high scores on anxiety symptoms. Uneven functioning and differential impact of resilience factors can help us understand the mixed successes in implementing resilience-based interventions for positive mental health and judiciously allocate scarce and finite resources for intervention.\nRead more\nDownload"

Studies have reported significant associations between physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and common mental health problems. This study investigated relations between participants’ reports of change in physical activity (PA; i.e., Reduced PA, Unchanged PA, or Increased PA) and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Norway in the time period from March 12, 2020 to June 15, 2020. The relations between age and gender and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms as well as how different levels of resilience influenced the relation between changes in PA and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms were also investigated. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants (N = 1,314; females = 31%) were members of an endurance sports organization aged between 18 and 81 years (M = 49 years; SD = 11.50 years). Participants completed the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported their changes in PA after lockdown restrictions were implemented on March 12, 2020. Regression analysis, independent samples t-test, and two-way multivariate analysis of variance were conducted. Reduced PA was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Younger participants in Reduced PA and Unchanged PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms and significantly higher on depression symptoms in Unchanged PA subgroup. Females in Unchanged PA and Increased PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms, whereas no gender differences were found for depression symptoms. The main and interaction effects of change in PA and resilience were significantly associated with depression symptoms. For anxiety symptoms, only the main effect of resilience, but not PA, and the interaction effect were significant. Results further showed that resilience was an important factor that influenced the levels of change in PA. High levels of resilience were associated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms in Reduced, Unchanged, and Increased PA subgroups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Promoting PA while boosting resilience factors such as confidence in own ability and drawing on the social support of even reduced social networks or connections while under lockdown can protect against common mental health problems.\nRead more\nDownload"

Thematic analysis explored the factors that may affect the quality of working alliances within different subgroups.\nResults Three distinct trajectories of housing stability emerged (i.e., Class 1: “sharp rise, sustained, and decline housing”; Class 2: “hardly any time housed”; Class 3: “high rise, sustained, and decline housing”) with professional helping relationships having different effects in each. The analysis revealed structural and individual circumstances that may explain differences among the classes.\nConclusions The findings underscore the role of professional helping relationships, as distinct from services, in major interventions for highly disadvantaged populations, and draws new attention to the temporal patterns of responses to both the quality of relationship and targeted interventions.\nRead more\nDownload"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives Sick leave due to anxiety and depression is a heterogeneous process constituting a pressing public health issue. This longitudinal study aimed to identify sick leave trajectories among patients before, during and after work-focused treatment, in all 29.5 months. We then aimed to determine the background and clinical characteristics of these trajectory groups.\nMethods Background and clinical data were collected by patient self-report (N=619) in an observational study in a specialised mental healthcare clinic. Sick leave was recorded from national registry data. A latent growth mixture model identified trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression determined differences in background characteristics while a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified clinical differences.\nResults We identified three trajectories: The ‘Resilient’ group (47.7%) had low sick leave throughout the period. The two other groups (‘Recovery’, 31.8% and ‘High risk’, 20.5%) had similar pretreatment trajectories: lower sick leave one year prior which increased to high sick leave at the start of treatment. After treatment, the ‘Recovery’ group made an almost full return to work while the ‘High risk’ group remained at high sick leave. The two groups with high sick leave had more women and higher age compared with the ‘Resilient’ group. All groups had similar clinical scores at the start of treatment, but the ‘High risk’ groups had residual depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. Effect sizes for anxiety and depression were moderate or large for all groups, (Cohen’s d=0.74–1.81), and 87.2% of the total sample were fully working one year after treatment.\nConclusion We found three subgroups with distinctly different trajectories. Female gender and higher age were associated with high sick leave at the start of treatment, while residual depressive symptoms at the end of treatment predicted continued sick leave. The study points to the possibility of improving patient outcomes in the future by stratifying and tailoring treatment to patient characteristics.\nRead here\nDownload"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cognitive models of social anxiety give prominence to dysfunctional schemas about the social self as the key underlying factors in maladaptive self-processing strategies and social anxiety symptoms. In contrast, the metacognitive model argues that beliefs about cognition represent a central belief domain underlying psychopathology and cognitive schemas as products of a thinking style regulated by metacognition. The present study therefore evaluated the temporal and reciprocal relations between metacognitive beliefs, social self-beliefs, and social anxiety symptoms to shed light on possible causal relationships among them. Eight hundred and sixty-eight individuals gathered at convenience participated in a four-wave online survey with each measurement wave 6 weeks apart. Using autoregressive cross-lagged panel models, we found significant temporal and reciprocal relations between metacognition, social self-beliefs (schemas), and social anxiety. Whilst social self-beliefs prospectively predicted social anxiety this relationship was reciprocal. Metacognitive beliefs prospectively predicted both social interaction anxiety and social self-beliefs, but this was not reciprocal. The results are consistent with metacognitive beliefs causing social anxiety and social self-beliefs and imply that negative social self-beliefs might be a product of metacognition. The clinical implications are that metacognitive beliefs should be the central target in treatments of social anxiety.\nRead more\nDownload"

    "text": "Purpose The existing evidence suggests that a complete evaluation of mental health should incorporate both psychopathology and mental well-being indicators. However, few studies categorize European adolescents into subgroups based on such complete mental health data. This study used the data on mental well-being and symptoms of mental and behavioral disorders to explore the mental health profiles of adolescents in Europe.\nMethods Data collected from adolescents (N = 3767; mean age 12.4 [SD = 0.9]) from five European countries supplied the information on their mental well-being (personal resilience, school resilience, quality of life, and mental well-being) and mental and behavioral disorder symptoms (anxiety, depression, stress, bullying, cyber-bullying, and use of tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis). Multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis were combined to classify the youths into mental health profiles.\nResults Adolescents were categorized into three mental health profiles. The “poor mental health” profile (6%) was characterized by low levels of well-being and moderate symptoms of mental disorders. The “good mental health” profile group (26%) showed high well-being and few symptoms of mental disorders, and the “intermediate mental health” profile (68%) was characterized by average well-being and mild-to-moderate symptoms of mental disorders. Groups with higher levels of well-being and fewer symptoms of mental disorders showed lower rates of behavioral problems. Mental well-being indicators strongly contributed to this classification.\nConclusion Adolescents with the “intermediate” or “poor” mental health profiles may benefit from interventions to improve mental health. Implications for school-based interventions are discussed.\nRead more\nDownload"

Proliferation of research on the resilience construct has led to scientific concerns about the operationalization and measurement of resilience for assessment science and practice. Various studies that have investigated the psychometric properties and construct validity of the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ) have yielded inconsistent findings, which could partly be due to variations in the methodological approaches. This study investigated the factor structure and construct validity of the READ in four European regions participating in the Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally Implemented in Schools to Improve and Promote Mental Health for Teenagers (UPRIGHT) project. Participants included adolescents aged 10–15 years from Spain (n = 391, females = 51%), Iceland (n = 379, females = 55%), Italy (n = 460, females = 55%), and Poland (n = 316, females = 51%). The five-factor model of the READ was similar across gender and participating regions. Construct validity of the READ was supported. After establishing construct separability, incremental validity was supported (except for the social competence subscale). The READ is a valid and reliable measure of protective factors involved in resilience and demonstrates promise for cross-cultural applicability. Recommendations for measuring resilience and validating the READ in future investigations are provided.\nRead more\nDownload"

    "text": "To expand evidence for the nature and related mechanisms underlying loneliness measured by Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults (SELSA-S), several hypotheses were developed and tested to map the nomological network of loneliness. Tests included examining the structure of the multidimensional experiences of loneliness, concurrent and prospective relations between loneliness, sociodemographic variables, worry, rumination, metacognition, symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study also sought to determine how resilience is involved in the protection against loneliness and depressive symptoms. Four hundred and eighty-two students with a mean age of 25.84 years (SD = 5.74) participated (N = 482; 59% females). Structural and temporal stability analyses supported the multidimensional experiences of loneliness, including family, romantic and social loneliness. Psychological network analysis identified especially strong connections (i.e., edges) between indicators belonging to loneliness in family and social relationships. At the general level, older participants and those who were single reported more loneliness. Loneliness was concurrently and prospectively associated with worry, rumination and metacognitions and predicted vulnerabilities in levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. At follow-up, the effect of loneliness on depressive symptoms was lower when scoring high on resilience. Interventions for loneliness may address improving family relationships and metacognitive processes underlying loneliness, which may in turn improve mental health. Interpersonal and intrapersonal protective factors involved in resilience may compensate for deficits in social relationships thereby buffering negative effects of loneliness on common mental health problems.\nRead more\nDownload"

Questions remain concerning relationships between MCQ-items (or domains) and the most central of these outside of the latent-factor model. In the present study we set out to explore the internal structure of the MCQ-30 using network analysis and estimated two graphical Gaussian models, one with items- and one with domains, in an unselected sample (N = 1080). The robustness and stability of the networks, as well as the node predictability were assessed. Among our observations was that the items of the MCQ-30 appeared to cluster in meaningful substructures, corresponding to metacognitive theory. Furthermore, “need for control” was the most centrally placed domain, suggesting it plays an important role in the network and that its activation has a strong influence on other nodes.

In the Metacognitive Control System model, dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs are seen as an underlying factor in psychological vulnerability beyond disorder, and recent studies have reported that metacognitions are associated with work ability and work status. In the present study, we set out to test if there is a prospective relationship between dysfunctional metacognitions and self-assessed work ability. Individuals in working age (M = 37.19; SD = 10.31) participated in a four-timepoint self-report survey (N = 528; 75% females) separated by six weeks between each timepoint. Baseline gender differences and differences between participants by job status were conducted using t-test and one-way ANOVA, respectively. Latent growth curve with covariates assessed the impact of dysfunctional metacognitions on work ability across the four timepoints. Males reported higher work ability. Participants in fulltime job also reported higher work ability followed by those in part-time job, jobseekers, sick leave up to 12 months, and sick leave &gt; 12 months, respectively. Dysfunctional metacognitions predicted work ability over time when controlling for gender, age, physical health status, and three common categories of emotional distress symptoms. This finding suggest that dysfunctional metacognitions are a prospective predictor of work ability beyond health status and implies that these beliefs should be targeted with a view to increasing work ability and thus potentially reduce risk for sick leave and other work-related problems.\nRead more\nDownload"

We first estimated the proportion of variance lying between the higher level of the data structure to account for potential therapists’ effects. Two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted testing change in interpersonal problems and negative metacognitive beliefs as predictors of change in trait-worry and trait-anxiety following treatment. Change in depression and anxiety symptoms was controlled.\nResults Change in negative metacognitive beliefs was the strongest predictor of improvement of both trait-worry and trait-anxiety. Change in interpersonal problems was not a unique predictor of change in trait-worry but did make a significant and unique contribution to trait-anxiety.\nConclusions Negative metacognitive beliefs may be important targets to improve trait-worry and trait-anxiety in GAD.

Confirmatory factor analysis was used on a sick-listed sample (n = 687) to identify the scale?s factor structure, and comparison with a university student sample (n = 241) was utilized to determine measurement invariance. Results show that a slightly modified factor structure, in accordance with previous research, achieved acceptable fit in the sick-listed sample, while comparisons with the student sample supported measurement invariance. This means that the study to a large degree support the factor structure of the resilience scale for adults in long-term sick-listed. Furthermore, the results indicate that the scale is similarly understood among long-term sick-listed as in a previously validated student sample.

    "text": "The metacognitive model of psychological disorders suggests that emotional disorders are related to maladaptive metacognitive strategies corresponding to underlying dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs. There is substantial empirical evidence supporting a role of metacognition in psychopathology, but fewer studies have evaluated the metacognitive model using longitudinal data and taken into consideration its differentiation between components and how they are hypothesized to be related to each other. Thus, more specific model evaluation is important as it relates to identifying mechanisms of disorder with a potential to provide clinical advances. In the present study, 868 participants took part in a 4-wave survey and reported on metacognitive beliefs and strategies and anxiety symptoms. Two longitudinal mediation models (forward and reversed causation) were run to test temporal precedence and bidirectional relations. The results indicated that metacognitive beliefs significantly predicted metacognitive strategies, which further predicted anxiety symptoms and mediated the indirect effect in the relationship between metacognitive beliefs and anxiety over time. The relationship between metacognitive beliefs and anxiety symptoms over time were bidirectional, but this relationship was not accounted for by metacognitive strategies. These findings largely support central predictions set forward by the metacognitive model and indicate that metacognitions play a preceding and maintaining role in anxiety.\nRead more\nDownload"

Negative metacognitive beliefs and beliefs about uncontrollability might have more functional significance in the mutual connections between dysfunctional meta-domains as well as the connections with metacognitive strategies and symptoms. For worry and anxiety, negative beliefs about uncontrollability and corresponding danger of worry were more prominently connected in the network structure. For rumination, cognitive self-consciousness was more prominent, whereas for depression, need for control was more prominently connected.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Researchers start their research by creating a null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no relationship between the variables being tested. They then collect data and use statistical tests to determine if the data is consistent with the null hypothesis, or if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\nA researcher may select a sample of 750 students from the population of all NTNU students to investigate the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety. Ideally, the researcher wants to make conclusions about the population of all NTNU students using sample statistics which is computed based on the sample of 750 students. A sample statistic is a numerical summary from the sample data. Here, the mean of exam anxiety for the 750 students or the correlation between attending lectures and exam anxiety for the 750 students is a sample statistic. Its corresponding numeric value for all NTNU students is called a parameter (or population parameter). Although the researcher works with a sample of 750 students, the ultimate interest is in the population of all NTNU students. But the parameter value is unknown unless the researcher can gather all NTNU students.\nIndeed, a hypothesis is stated in reference to the population (e.g., there is no difference in height between the population of males and females), but sample data is used to test the hypothesis, which is how inferences about the population are drawn from the sample data.\nIt is almost impossible or could be very expensive and time consuming to test the entire population.\nSo, what does the researcher do?\nThe researcher uses sample statistics as estimates for the corresponding population parameters. But this has some problems due to sampling error or random variability. This is because whenever the researcher samples different groups of 750 students, the researcher may observe a mean of 4.50 for exam anxiety in Group 1 and 5.20 in Group 2 and yet still 3.75 in Group 3. This random variability in a sample statistic such as the mean of exam anxiety from sample to sample is called sampling error.\nSo, what does this mean for the researcher´s conclusions?\nIf the researcher makes conclusions based on the sample of 750 students, it will not be guaranteed that the conclusion will be observed in the population of all NTNU students due to sampling error. It could be that the mean of exam anxiety is not even close to any of the sample means and it could also be that the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety observed in the sample of 750 students, will not exist and that there will be no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety at all in the population. This would mean that the observed relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in the sample of 750 students is just due to sampling error or occurred by chance. This problem can be reduced or mitigated by power analysis and sample size calculations prior as part of the research design and prior to data calculation.\nNull hypothesis significance testing is a statistical technique used to determine if the results of a study occurred by chance, or if they are a true effect in the population. The general idea underpinning null hypothesis significance testing is based on the observed relationship in the sample data, which is that:\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects sampling error or very likely occurred by chance. Thus, no true effect or relationship exists in the population.\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects a true effect or relationship in the population. Thus, it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\n\nLet’s say that a researcher starts with a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety, and collects data from 750 students of NTNU. The researcher must choose a level of significance (such as 0.05) that represents the proportion of times (that, if the null hypothesis is true), a researcher will mistakenly reject the null hypothesis, or put simply, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis in the long run (i.e., over several random samples from the population) if the null hypothesis is actually true.\nIf the null hypothesis is true (that, there is no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety), and a researcher mistakenly rejects it (therefore says that, there is a relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety), this is called making a Type-1 error, and the probability of a researcher making this type of erroneous conclusion is set at 0.05 (as the alpha level). Thus, the level of significance or alpha can also be understood as the probability of making a Type-1 error, supposing the null hypothesis is true. This is because the level of significance or alpha is the threshold below which the decision to reject the null hypothesis is made. Consequently, supposing that the null hypothesis is true, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, thereby making a Type-1 error is the significance level or alpha that was chosen for the hypothesis test. Here, the researcher mistakenly concludes that there is something (or there is an effect or relationship) when there is nothing (no effect or no relationship). There is another error that can be made in hypothesis testing.\nLet’s briefly summarize the two types of errors in significance testing:\nSuppose the null hypothesis is true:\n\n\nA Type-1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected.\n\n\nSuppose the null hypothesis is false:\n\n\nA Type-2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n\n\nGoing back to our example, if the p-value is less than the level of significance or alpha, the researcher concludes that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For example, if a correlation test shows a very low p-value, say p &lt; 0.05, this means that it is extremely or very unlikely that the results of the correlation test occurred by chance if the null hypothesis was true. The p-value is the probability of observing the sample data or one that is more extreme, if the null hypothesis was true.\nWhen the p-value, or the probability of observing the results given the null hypothesis, is less than the significance level or alpha, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there is a significant relationship or effect between the variables being tested - that is, the relationship in the sample data reflects true effect or relationship in the population. For example, there is a significant relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in NTNU students.\nRejecting the null hypothesis doesn’t necessarily ‘prove’ that the alternative hypothesis is true. It simply means that based on the available evidence - that is, based on the sample data, it is more likely that there is a relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety than that there isn’t. The decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on several factors, including the significance level or alpha, which specifies the maximum probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis if it is actually true in the population."

In this way, the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in the sample of 750 students reflects a true effect in the population of all NTNU students from which the sample of 750 students was drawn."

    "text": "We can analyse the association between two categorical variables in different ways (e.g., using stacked bar graphs or pie charts). The most common way is to use contingency tables with rows and columns displaying categories of each variable. The count or frequency of each pair of categories are given in a cell.\nWe will see how to analyse the association between two categorical variables using different functions in different packages in RStudio. The CrossTbale() function seems to be very popular as is the chisq.test() function. Another function is the ggbarstats() in the ‘ggstatsplot’ package. This package produces beautiful plots and charts that are publication-ready with good quality. By plotting your pie chart or stacked bar graph, the ggpiestats() and the ggbarstats() function also compute the Chi-squared test statistic, with very useful information in addition, including a Bayesian effect size.\nTo test the null hypothesis, we can use the CrossTable() function in the ‘gmodels’ package. Note that the CrossTable() can take both raw data and contingency table."

We can say that, the observed count is 2.49 standard deviations below (because of the negative sign, -2.49) the expected count for this particular cell. The substantive interpretation is that, for people with above average family income, many fewer were not happy than what the model predicted or, in other words, what the assumption of independence between income and happiness would predict.\nWe can interpret positive standardized residuals first, followed by negative standardized residuals.\n\n\nFor standardized residuals 5.83 and 3.96, the observed count is much higher than the expected count (more than 3 standard deviations higher). For people who reported below average family income, many more were not happy. For people who reported above average family income, many more were very happy.\n\n\nFor standardized residuals -3.41, -2.02 and -5.13, the observed count is much lower than the expected count.

This support the previous conclusion that, the association between income and happiness seems to be driven by above average family income.\nThis function automatically outputs the Cramer’s V with its 95% Confidence Interval next to the p-value. The effect size of .12 is a relatively weak association. It also provides a corresponding Bayesian effect size, which is much more useful. There is also a Bayes factor, which tests both the null and alternative hypothesis at the same time. The designation of ‘01’ returns a Bayes Factor in favor of the null hypothesis whereas ‘10’ returns a Bayes Factor in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The Bayes factor shows that the null hypothesis does not do well compared to the alternative hypothesis. This is evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis that, there is an association between family income and happiness.\nFinally, this function shows the proportion test for family income (below average, average and above average) in each category of happiness (not happy, pretty happy, and very happy) under the null hypothesis that the sample proportions are not equal. They show whether the proportions inside each category of happiness differ. Since the p-values are all very small, we can conclude that the sample proportions of family income within each category of happiness differs. This type of Chi-squared test is referred to as the Chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistic, used to test hypothesis involving a single categorical variable from a single sample."

Some preliminary steps might even already show whether the data will support your hypothesized growth function or to fit a different growth function.

    "text": "This tutorial compares different models of change when presented with data collected at two time points - which could be pre-test and post test data or some other form of observational data.\n1. Difference Score Model of Change\nThe Raw Change Model also called the Difference Score Model is probably the most obvious and common. A researcher computes change between two time points by subtracting T1 scores from T2 scores (T2 - T1). Resulting from this subtraction whether greater or lesser is the change that has occurred between two time points. The Difference Score Model examine between-person differences in the change that has occurred within individuals from T1 to T2. Common in this model of change is to use the computed (resulting) change or difference (D), that is, T2 - T1 = D, as an outcome in subsequent analysis - which is why it is often called the Difference Score Model\nThis approach is, however, heavily criticized and has a rather bad reputation even until today, and started with Cronbach & Furby, 1970\n\n\n“Raw change” or “raw gain” scores formed by subtracting pretest scores from posttest scores lead to fallacious conclusions, primarily because such scores are systematically related to any random error of measurement. Although the unsuitability of such scores has long been discussed, they are still employed, even by some otherwise sophisticated investigators. Cronbach & Furby, 1970, p. 68\n\n\nThe Difference Score Model is badly reputed mainly for the following:\n\n\nHigh correlation between T1 scores and the computed D scores. With very high T1 scores, the D tends to be highly negatively correlated.\n\n\nMeasurement error contained in T1 and T2 scores become attenuated in the computed D scores, greatly limiting the reliability of the computed D scores.\n\n\nSome authors have suggested ways to mitigate the problems of the Difference Score Model including, to account for the confounding effects of T1 when using the computed D scores in subsequent analysis. See Rogosa & Willett, 1983; Gottman & Rushe, 1993\n2. Autoregressive Model of Change\nThe Autoregressive Model of Change focuses on the end state by using T2 as the DV and T1 as the predictor. This model responds to questions about individual differences in change by regressing T2 on T1, and does not answer questions about intraindividual change same as for many panel models. The regression coefficient resulting from regressing a variable at later time point on itself at an earlier time point is called the autoregressive effect. In this case, the regression of T2 on T1 is the autoregressive effect, which describes the stability of individual differences from T1 to T2.\n\n\nA larger coefficient means that individual differences have not changed much from T1 to T2 - higher stability.\n\n\nA smaller autoregressive coefficient means that there has been a larger change in individual differences from T1 to T2 - lower stability.\n\n\nThe Autoregressive Model of Change has had some appeal since the 70s and obviously since the criticisms of the Difference Score Model by Cronbach & Furby, 1970, p. 68. The appealing feature of the The Autoregressive Model of Change stems from the fact that when T2 is regressed on T1 (autoregressive effect), the remaining variance or the residual variance in T2 can be predicted by other variables in which case, this becomes the prediction of the stable portion of variable T, say our variable is T measured at T1 and T2. This is what cross-lagged effects are most useful for, as for example, T2 can be regressed on both T1 and X1, which means X1 will predict T2 when controlling for prior levels of T at T1. So, X1 effectively predicts the stable portion or the residual variance of T (at T2) - which is why this mode is sometimes called residual change model.\nIn the Autoregressive Cross-lagged Panel Models, controlling for prior levels of a variable while predicting the residual variance by another variable allows a researcher to rule out the possibility that a cross-lagged effect is confounded by the fact that the predictor (X) and outcome (T) are both correlated at T1. That is, the reason X1 predicts T2 is because X and T are correlated at T1 - this cannot hold when controlling for the prior levels of T. Most Autoregressive Model of Change and the Autoregressive Cross-lagged Panel Models have appeared in both observed or latent variable modeling.\n3. Latent Difference Score Model of Change\nThe Latent Difference Score also called the Latent Change Score Model is seen by some methodologists as a framework on its own for modelling change with the capability for testing within-person change hypotheses and between-person differences in within-person change. Like the Autoregressive Models of Change, this Latent Change Score Model can accommodate bivariate information in which two variables are modeled concurrently with cross-lagged effects. The Latent Change Score Model starts by decomposing an observed variable into a latent true score and a latent residual score. This model incorporates the autoregressive effect into the latent true score such that the true score at T2 is a function of the latent true score at T1, plus the amount of change that has occurred between T1 and T2. The Latent Change Score Model extends over four successive models of change namely, no change, constant change, proportional change and dual change. The dual change combines both constant and proportional change components. In my opinion, the Latent Change Score Model is useful when bivariate information is incorporated thereby responding to questions about the nature and sequence of subsequent changes in x versus y. In other words, which variable between x and y is a leading indicator of subsequent changes in the other variable?\nResearchers must think very carefully of their theories of change when selecting between the different existing models. The Latent Change Score Model while offering greater flexibility in modelling within-person changes and between-person differences in within-person change, emphasizes time-dependent associations when bivariate or multivariate information is incorporated, and this must be carefully considered to benefit from this modelling framework.\nLoad packages\n\nCodesuppressPackageStartupMessages({\nlibrary(lcsm)   #For analyzing the latent change score model\nlibrary(ggplot2) #For visualization \n})\n\n\nRead data\n\nCodedata &lt;- read.csv(\"/Volumes/anyan/Quant_Resources/0000 Workshops/000_01_Dec_2023_NTNU/data.csv\")\ndata &lt;- data[, c(\"personid\", \"lone3\", \"lone5\")] #Create new data set with only your main outcome variables\nnames(data) &lt;- c(\"id\", \"loneT1\", \"loneT2\") #Rename variables to represent T1 and T2\n\n\n\n\nDifference Score Model\nAutoregressive Model\nLatent Change Score Model\n\n\n\nDetermine the difference score (T2-T1 = D)\n\nCodedata$lonediff &lt;- data$loneT2-data$loneT1 #You can attach the new variable lonediff to the data with $\n\n\nNow regress D on T1\n\nCodediffM &lt;- lm(formula = lonediff ~ 1 + loneT1,\n             data = data,\n             na.action = na.exclude)\nsummary(diffM)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = lonediff ~ 1 + loneT1, data = data, na.action = na.exclude)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.75462 -0.17873 -0.07593  0.08014  2.10763 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The slope of loneT1 (0.31) indicates the stability of between-person differences from T1 to T2. The autoregressive coefficient show that individual differences in loneliness is moderately stable between the two time points as the autoregressive coefficient is about moderate size.\nRemember T1 and T2 were originally (lone3 at T3) and (lone5 at T5), which means that the distance between time points is longer than it would be for adjacent time points (lone3 at T3 and lone4 at T4 versus lone4 at T4 and lone5 at T5). The longer time that elapses between measurement occasions, the higher it is that the autoregressive effect depreciates and thereby resulting in less stability of individual differences from one occasion to the next. Therefore, the time lag between time points is very crucial in panel models since this may have implications for when hypothesized autoregressive or cross-lagged effects may disappear.\nWe expect a positive difference of (0.31) in loneliness at T2 for a every unit change in loneliness at T1\n\nCodeggplot(data = data, aes(x = loneT1, y = loneT2)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula= y ~ 1 + x, \n              se = TRUE, fullrange = TRUE, color=\"blue\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  xlab(\"Loneliness T1\") + \n  ylab(\"Loneliness T2\") +\n  ggtitle(\"The Autoregressive Model of Chang\")\n\nWarning: Removed 73 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 73 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot represents the expected positive difference in loneliness at T2 for a every unit change in loneliness at T1\n\n\nTBC"

    "text": "Research questions examining within-person changes or joint within-person changes and between-person differences in the stability and change in individuals’ attributes over time make longitudinal data incredibly useful. Longitudinal data offers many possibilities to describe differences in how and when people change and explain why. Methodological limitations in calculating difference score, taking residualized scores, correlation among repeated measures, and other limitations mean that appropriate growth models must be estimated.\nStructural Equation Modelling (SEM) is a family of related analysis techniques – correlations, regression analyses and factor analyses, using both observed and unobserved (latent) variables to offer a flexible framework for analysing longitudinal data (and cross-sectional data too). Analysing growth models in the SEM framework provide a highly convenient and statistically rigorous framework for applied research in the social, behavioural, and educational sciences.\nThis course is a data analysis course, not a statistics course and will cover basic and advanced longitudinal SEM model using Mplus in a very easy and efficient implementation. Additionally, to make the course more ‘theory- and practice-based’ than ‘equations-based’, the models that will be estimated will be guided by the overarching objectives of longitudinal research described in the seminal work of Baltes and Nasselroade (1979).\nDownload"
