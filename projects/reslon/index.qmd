Resilience to Loneliness for Mental and Physical Health outcomes(RESLON-MPH) investigates the complex interplay between biological systems, psychological and social-environmental factors in loneliness for mental and physical health outcomes. The RESLON-MPH project will use various research approaches combining intensive longitudinal data (e.g., experienced sampling methods), large-scale genetic studies (e.g., genome-wide association studies - GWAS), and intranasal oxytocin trials.
