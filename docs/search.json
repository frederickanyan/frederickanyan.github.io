    "text": "My teaching in undergraduate quantitative method course focuses on understanding and emphasizing statistical concepts and their applications more than mathematics, computational details and theoretical derivatives in the statistical methodology. Occasionally, and depending on context and need, my teaching in advanced and graduate-level quantitative method will add computational and statistical details to understanding concepts and their applications.\nMy research focuses on the application and assessment of quantitative methods in the social and behavioural sciences. Specifically, I focus on combining innovative statistical methods and substantive interests into a single program of research that seeks to understand, improve and promote adaptive psychological functioning and resilience in the following areas:\nLongitudinal analyses of the mental health, vulnerability and protective factors among Norwegian Afghanistan veterans. Investigating what factors contribute to the complex interplay between biological systems, psychological and social-environmental factors in perpetuating the feeling of loneliness and social isolation and the consequences for mental and physical health outcomes. Investigating how individuals recruit multiple protective systems (biological, psychological, social-environmental, community, and ecological factors) to respond to adversity. Investigating the central mechanisms (beliefs, awareness, strategies, and executive functioning) in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders and important targets in treatments inspired by the Metacognitive Control System Model\nMy expertise in applied analysis in panel and intensive longitudinal data, as well as structural equation modelling (SEM) and hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) enables my participation in research to uncover subtle patterns in complex data sets, teasing apart minute details to reveal crucial insights that could inform effective interventions.\nBeyond research, I am very approachable and a passionate mentor and educator, with a deep commitment to sharing my expertise, taking active role in training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. With a diverse quantitative and substantive research program that influences both theory and practice, I strive not only to make meaningful contributions to the scientific community through teaching and research, but also, train the next generation of researchers. So, you are welcome to contact me."

If one identifies this subgroup and connects data from HUNT with the Armed Forces’ health surveys, this will provide a unique opportunity to find links between risk factors (lifestyle or environment) and the development of good or bad health (illness) after international deployments, and also to understand how resilience and constellations of specific robustness factors might differ in a civilian and veteran sample."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This cross-sectional study investigated the relation of sociocultural prescriptions of gender role socializations to differences in stress at home and to anxiety and depressive symptoms for adolescent girls and boys, with family cohesion as a mediator. A total of 244 boys and 285 girls aged 13–17 years recruited from Accra, Ghana completed the Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Stress of Home Life and Family Cohesion self-report scales in April 2015. In each sample, two mediation analyses were conducted using Structural Equation Modelling. Exposure to stress at home that was perceived to result from sociocultural prescriptions of gender role norms largely accounted for anxiety and depressive symptoms among girls, whereas this relation was non-significant among boys. Significant indirect relations through low family cohesion to anxiety symptoms were observed for girls and boys but not to depressive symptoms for boys. These findings suggest that differences in gender role socializations at home may account for individual differences in associations between exposure to stress at home and anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as explain the differential indirect relations through low family cohesion. Improving family cohesion while reducing stress at home may contribute to reducing stress and thus anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nDownload"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper analyzes the power relation between the interviewer and the interviewee in the qualitative research interview methodology. The paper sets out to grapple with the extent to which the dynamisms in power shifts influence data collection and analysis in the interview methodology. The exploration of power shifts in the qualitative research interview facilitates comprehensive understanding of the nuances of the data by providing more information about the interviewee and the interviewer. This enhances a deeper discerning into the research process, and the topics discussed. This paper also elaborates on how interviewees as well as interviewers display their countermeasures to each other in the course of the interview situation and presents a greater understanding of the power dynamics that exist between the interviewer and interviewee. Power asymmetry seems to be an exasperating circumstance in the interview methodology as pointed out by the discussions in this article. This article also discusses practical recommendations for minimizing the power dynamics during data analysis in the qualitative research interview.\nDownload"

    "text": "This qualitative study explored the role of religious faith, belief and practice systems in the coping mechanisms and strategies of essential hypertension patients in Accra, Ghana. Six participants were recruited for participation, of which five were Christians and one was a Muslim. Interviews were conducted and interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyze the data. Results showed that participants used their religious faith, beliefs and practices as coping resources. Participants used a deferring-collaborative style of religious coping, which seemed to have provided them with an avoidance strategy that protected the participants from conscious confrontation with their illness. Religious faith and beliefs also afforded the participants a sense of coherence that enabled the participants to manage their stress, reflect on their external and internal resources to promote effective coping and adaptive functioning in a health promoting manner. Implications of a deferring-collaborative style of religious coping and religious re-appraisal are discussed.\nDownload"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Resilience has provided a useful framework that elucidates the effects of protective factors to overcome psychological adversities but studies that address the potential contingencies of resilience to protect against direct and indirect negative effects are lacking. These obvious gaps have also resulted in oversimplification of complex processes that can be clarified by moderated mediation associations. This study examines a conditional process modelling of the protective effects of resilience against indirect effects.\nMethod Two separate samples were recruited in a cross-sectional survey from Australia and Norway to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire −9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Stressful Negative Life Events Questionnaire and the Resilience Scale for Adults. The final sample sizes were 206 (females = 114; males = 91; other = 1) and 210 (females = 155; males = 55) for Australia and Norway respectively. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted across the samples.\nResults Anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between exposure to stressful negative life events and depressive symptoms in both samples. Conditional indirect effects of exposure to stressful negative life events on depressive symptoms mediated by anxiety symptoms showed that high subgroup of resilience was associated with less effect of exposure to stressful negative life events through anxiety symptoms on depressive symptoms than the low subgroup of resilience.\nLimitations As a cross-sectional survey, the present study does not answer questions about causal processes despite the use of a conditional process modelling.\nConclusions These findings support that, resilience protective resources can protect against both direct and indirect – through other channels – psychological adversities.\nDownload"

    "text": "Background Some adolescents exhibit resilience even in the face of high levels of stress exposure. Despite this relationship, studies that investigate explanations for how resilience interacts with risk to produce particular outcomes and why this is so are lacking. The effect of resilience across the relationship between stress and symptoms of anxiety and stress and symptoms of depression was tested to provide explanations for how resilience interacts with stress and symptoms of anxiety, and depression.\nMethod In a cross-sectional survey, 533 Ghanaian adolescents aged 13–17 years (M=15.25, SD=1.52), comprising 290 girls and 237 boys completed the Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Adolescent Stress Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, and Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted.\nResults The results indicated that resilience partially mediated the relationship between stress, and symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Effects of stress were negatively associated with resilience, and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. In a differential moderator effect, resilience moderated the relationship between stress and symptoms of depression but not stress and symptoms of anxiety.\nLimitations Although the findings in this study are novel, they do not answer questions about protective mechanisms or processes.\nConclusions Evidence that resilience did not have the same effect across stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression may support resilience as a dynamic process model. Access to different levels of resilience shows that enhancing resilience while minimizing stress may improve psychiatric health in adolescents’ general population.\nDownload"

    "title": "Null Hypothesis Testing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Researchers start their research by creating a null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no difference or relationship between the variables being tested. They then collect data and use statistical tests to determine if the data is consistent with the null hypothesis (i.e., retain the null hypothesis), or if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Formally approaching the decision to retain or reject the null hypothesis is called Null Hypothesis Testing.\nA researcher may select a sample of 750 students from the population of all NTNU students to investigate the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety. Ideally, the researcher wants to make conclusions about the population of all NTNU students using sample statistics which is computed based on the sample of 750 students. A sample statistic is a numerical summary from the sample data. Here, the mean of exam anxiety for the 750 students or the correlation between attending lectures and exam anxiety for the 750 students is a sample statistic. Its corresponding numeric value for all NTNU students is called a parameter (or population parameter). Although the researcher works with a sample of 750 students, the ultimate interest is in the population of all NTNU students. But the parameter value is unknown unless the researcher can gather all NTNU students.\nSo, what does the researcher do?\nThe researcher uses sample statistics as estimates for the corresponding population parameters. But this has some problems due to sampling error or random variability. This happens because whenever the researcher samples different groups of 750 students, the researcher may observe a mean of 4.50 for exam anxiety in Group 1 and 5.20 in Group 2 and yet still 3.75 in Group 3. This random variability in a sample statistic such as the mean of exam anxiety from sample to sample is called sampling error.\nSo, what does this mean for the researcher´s conclusions?\nIf the researcher makes conclusions based on the sample of 750 students, it will not be guaranteed that the conclusion will be observed in the population of all NTNU students as we have seen with sampling error. It could be that the mean of exam anxiety is not even close to any of the sample means and it could also be that the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety observed in the sample of 750 students, will not exist and that there will be no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety at all in the population, which means that the observed relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in the sample of 750 students is just due to sampling error or occurred by chance.\nSo, null hypothesis testing is a statistical technique used to determine if the results of a study occurred by chance, or if they are a true effect in the population.\nThere are many different ways to decide between retaining or rejecting the null hypothesis, but the general idea is based on the observed relationship in the sample, based on which the researcher makes inferences to the population. Consequently, the general idea is that:\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects sampling error or very likely occurred by chance. Thus, no true effect or relationship exists in the population.\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects a true effect or relationship in the population. Thus, it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\n\nLet’s say that a researcher starts with a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety, and collects data from 750 students of NTNU. The researcher must first choose a level of significance (such as 0.05) that represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. If the p-value is less than the level of significance, the researcher can conclude that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For example, if a correlation test shows a very low p-value, say p < 0.05, this means that it is extremely or very unlikely that the results of the correlation test occurred by chance if the null hypothesis was true.\nSince the p-value, or the probability of observing the results given the null hypothesis, is less than the significance level, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, which states that there is a significant relationship or effect between the variables being tested - that is, the observed relationship in the sample data reflects true effect or relationship in the population. So, there is a signifcant relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in NTNU students.\nRejecting the null hypothesis doesn’t necessarily prove that the alternative hypothesis is true. It simply means that based on the available evidence, it is more likely that there is a relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety than that there isn’t. The decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on several factors, including the significance level, or alpha, which specifies the maximum probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis if it is actually true in the population.\nIn the next post, I will tell you the importance of null hypothesis testing for making predictions about the population using sample data (i.e., statistics)."

Being able to make inferences about the population, even if the researcher only has data from a sample of that population, is because the researcher has determined that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance (through null hypothesis testing - see the previous post), and so the results are representative of the population as a whole.
