Occasionally, and depending on context and need, my teaching in advanced and graduate-level quantitative method will add computational and statistical details to understanding concepts and their applications.\nMy research focuses on the application and assessment of quantitative methods in the social and behavioural sciences. Specifically, I focus on combining innovative statistical methods and substantive interests into a single program of research that seeks to understand, improve and promote adaptive psychological functioning and resilience in the following areas:\nLongitudinal analyses of the mental health, vulnerability and protective factors among Norwegian Afghanistan veterans. Investigating what factors contribute to the complex interplay between biological systems, psychological and social-environmental factors in perpetuating the feeling of loneliness and social isolation and the consequences for mental and physical health outcomes. Investigating how individuals recruit multiple protective systems (biological, psychological, social-environmental, community, and ecological factors) to respond to adversity. Investigating the central mechanisms (beliefs, awareness, strategies, and executive functioning) in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders and important targets in treatments inspired by the Metacognitive Control System Model\nMy expertise in applied analysis in panel and intensive longitudinal data, as well as structural equation modelling (SEM) and hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) enables my participation in research to uncover subtle patterns in complex data sets, teasing apart minute details to reveal crucial insights that could inform effective interventions.\nBeyond research, I am very approachable and a passionate mentor and educator, with a deep commitment to sharing my expertise, taking active role in training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

Thus, this study goes beyond lumping together potential mediating and moderating processes that can explain the relations between stress and (symptoms of) psychopathology and the buffering effect of resilience.\nMethods Ghanaian adolescents between 13 and 17 years (female = 285; male = 244) completed the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire (ASQ), Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ). Independent samples t-test, multivariate analysis of covariance with follow-up tests and moderated mediation analyses were performed.\nResults Evidences were found for specificity in the associations between dimensions of adolescent stressors and depressive symptoms independent of transient anxiety. Transient anxiety partly accounted for the indirect effects of eight stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Except stress of school attendance and school/leisure conflict, resilience moderated the indirect effects of specific stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Results suggested differences in how Ghanaian adolescents view the various stress dimensions, and mediated pathways associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nLimitations Use of cross-sectional data does not show causal process and temporal changes over time.\nConclusions Findings support and clarify the specificity in the interrelations and mediated pathways among dimensions of adolescent stress, transient anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Conditional process analyses shows that resilience does not only buffer direct, but also indirect psychological adversities. Interventions for good mental health may focus on low resilience subgroups in specific stress dimensions while minimizing transient anxiety.\nRead more"

The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention.\nMethods UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48 months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning.\nAmong the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods.\nDiscussion We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.\nRead more"

The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) is one of the best psychometrically rated scales and has been validated among Norwegian samples. The purpose of this study was to explore the construct validity of the RSA in an English-speaking Australian sample and test measurement invariance between the Australian sample and a Norwegian sample. An Australian sample (N = 781) completed the RSA, Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7). A second sample of Norwegians (N = 320) was included in the analyses of invariance of the RSA across cultures. There were expected negative correlations between RSA and PHQ-9, and between RSA and GAD-7, but positive correlations between RSA and SOC-13. The results indicated that the six-factor measurement model of the RSA is the same in the Australian and Norwegian samples, and respondents from the two cultures understood and interpreted the items in a comparable fashion. Support was found for the cross-cultural validity of the RSA in an English-speaking Australian sample and as a valid and reliable self-report measure of protective factors.\nRead more"

UPRIGHT implemented a co-creation research process whose results, outcomes and policy implications are presented here. The co-creation had a mixed-methods participatory research design with nine specific objectives linked to paired strategies of inquiry for adolescents, families, teachers and school staff. The overarching objective was to generate a valid and feasible regional adaptation strategy for UPRIGHT intervention model. Participants answered surveys (n = 794) or attended 16 group sessions (n = 217). The results integrate quantitative and qualitative information to propose a regional adaptation strategy that prioritizes resilience skills, adolescents’ concerns, and preferred methods for implementation across countries and in each school community. In conclusion, a whole-school resilience program must innovate, include and connect different actors, services and communities, and must incorporate new technologies and activities outside the classroom.

    "text": "Resilience is the ability of an individual or community to adapt to life challenges or adversities while maintaining mental health and well-being. In the multi-systemic resilience paradigm, human development and resilience is embedded in adaptive systems and in their interactions. Although the relationship between school systems and adolescents’ mental wellbeing is established, there is no agreement on how to recognize and evaluate the most relevant aspects of the school community, acting at collective level, to boost positive socio-emotional and educational outcomes in children and adolescents. This study presents the development and preliminary validation of a new and theory-driven construct and instrument, the School Resilience Scale for Adults (SRS). School Resilience comprises five interrelated constructs (i.e. Positive relationships, Belonging, Inclusion, Participation, and Mental health awareness) connected theoretically to wellbeing and resilience in children and adolescents. The scale development was theory-driven, and the instrument was tested in four European counties in the frame of the UPRIGHT project (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers). Overall, 340 adults participated, 129 teachers and school staff, and 211 relatives of teenagers. The sample was randomly split for two studies: (1) an Exploratory Factor analysis (ESEM), and (2) Confirmatory Factor (CFA) analysis. In the exploratory analysis, Chi-Square difference test and model fit indices point towards the five-factor solution over a three-factor solution. The confirmatory study indicated that a five-factor model (RMSEA = 0.038, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.045) was slightly better than a second-order model (RMSEA = 0.046, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, SRMR = 0.05). Convergent and discriminant validities were partially demonstrated. Alpha and omega reliability coefficients verified the measurement model of the scale. The results confirmed that a multidimensional construct of School Resilience, defined as a collective resilience factor, embedded in the school staff, family members, and adolescents’ interrelated systems can be characterized and measured. Further studies must determine its role in the promotion of adolescents’ resilience, mental wellbeing, educational outcomes, and in their positive adaptation in challenging contexts.\nRead more"

A total of 244 boys and 285 girls aged 13–17 years recruited from Accra, Ghana completed the Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Stress of Home Life and Family Cohesion self-report scales in April 2015. In each sample, two mediation analyses were conducted using Structural Equation Modelling. Exposure to stress at home that was perceived to result from sociocultural prescriptions of gender role norms largely accounted for anxiety and depressive symptoms among girls, whereas this relation was non-significant among boys. Significant indirect relations through low family cohesion to anxiety symptoms were observed for girls and boys but not to depressive symptoms for boys. These findings suggest that differences in gender role socializations at home may account for individual differences in associations between exposure to stress at home and anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as explain the differential indirect relations through low family cohesion. Improving family cohesion while reducing stress at home may contribute to reducing stress and thus anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nRead more"

Results showed that participants used their religious faith, beliefs and practices as coping resources. Participants used a deferring-collaborative style of religious coping, which seemed to have provided them with an avoidance strategy that protected the participants from conscious confrontation with their illness. Religious faith and beliefs also afforded the participants a sense of coherence that enabled the participants to manage their stress, reflect on their external and internal resources to promote effective coping and adaptive functioning in a health promoting manner.

These obvious gaps have also resulted in oversimplification of complex processes that can be clarified by moderated mediation associations. This study examines a conditional process modelling of the protective effects of resilience against indirect effects.\nMethod Two separate samples were recruited in a cross-sectional survey from Australia and Norway to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire −9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Stressful Negative Life Events Questionnaire and the Resilience Scale for Adults. The final sample sizes were 206 (females = 114; males = 91; other = 1) and 210 (females = 155; males = 55) for Australia and Norway respectively. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted across the samples.\nResults Anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between exposure to stressful negative life events and depressive symptoms in both samples. Conditional indirect effects of exposure to stressful negative life events on depressive symptoms mediated by anxiety symptoms showed that high subgroup of resilience was associated with less effect of exposure to stressful negative life events through anxiety symptoms on depressive symptoms than the low subgroup of resilience.\nLimitations As a cross-sectional survey, the present study does not answer questions about causal processes despite the use of a conditional process modelling.\nConclusions These findings support that, resilience protective resources can protect against both direct and indirect – through other channels – psychological adversities.\nRead more"

An adult sample of community controls completed the Perceived stress scale 14 (PSS-14), the Resilience scale for adults (RSA), the Patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7). Independent samples t-test, correlation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. The results showed that resilience moderated the relations between stress and anxiety symptoms (β = −0.131, p < 0.001) as well as between stress and depressive symptoms (β = −0.068, p < 0.05). In support of a moderated mediation model, resilience moderated the indirect effect of stress on depressive symptom, as confirmed by the index of moderated mediation (IMM = −0.036, p < 0.001; [95% BCa: −0.055, −0.020]). The high resilience subgroup was less affected than the low resilience subgroup by the effect of stress exposure symptoms of depression, mediated by anxiety. The study shows that stress exposure is associated with symptoms of depression, and anxiety mediates this association.

However, empirical exploration of prospective and reciprocal relations between worry and rumination are lacking. This study investigated the stability and relations between worry and rumination to better understand how they influence each other over time, and how different levels of metacognitive beliefs affect relations between (i) initial and future worry, and initial and future rumination, and (ii) the cross-lag relations between worry and rumination. Overall, 482 (Females = 63%) participants (Mean age = 26 years) participated in a two-wave data collection and completed the Metacognition Questionnaire (MCQ-30), the Ruminative Response Scale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). A multigroup two-wave autoregressive cross-lagged model was estimated. Multigroup autoregression analyses revealed that independent of participants being in the high or low metacognition group, initial levels of worry predicted future levels of worry, as was the case for rumination. Multigroup cross-lagged analyses revealed that initial levels of worry did not predict future levels of rumination in both high and low levels of metacognitions. However, initial rumination predicted future levels of worry in the high metacognitions group, which was not the case for the low metacognitions group. Thus, high levels of metacognitions do not only strengthen the relation between both present and future worry, present and future rumination, but also present rumination with future worry. This finding may imply that those with rumination related conditions at present are more likely in the future to show both rumination and worry related conditions. Conversely, those with worry related conditions show future worry related conditions. These findings may have implications for a clinical sample regarding the high complexity of rumination conditions that may proceed with multifinality causal pathways especially for individuals with high levels of metacognitions. This complexity may be a possible explanation for the limited success in other traditional treatment of rumination related conditions and the relatively high relapse rates for such conditions in clinical samples.\nRead more"

However, social loneliness might be an exception since it also had a direct effect on levels of depressive symptoms.\nConclusions To prevent or reduce loneliness and common mental health problems, evidence provided show that interventions may incorporate components that target self-focused negative thinking in the form of worry or beliefs about the contents of negative thinking in the form of metacognitive beliefs, underlying loneliness and mental health problems.\nRead more"

Recently, it is emerging that anxiety precedes depression but not the reverse, and markedly increase in response to stress giving way to depression. As such, anxiety itself could be a predictive risk factor, and mediate the associations between stress and depression. While resilience protects against exposure to stress and common mental health problems, it is unclear to what extent different resilience factors are differentially involved in protection against anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study explored complex theoretical associations between interpersonal stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms and resilience factors.\nMaterials and methods Participants (N = 210 adults) completed the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Stressful Life Events Questionnaire (SLE) in a cross-sectional survey. Hierarchical linear regressions and moderated-mediation analyses were performed using PROCESS macro.\nResults Interpersonal stress explained more variance in depressive than anxiety symptoms. Support was found for the mediating effect of anxiety symptoms in the relationship between interpersonal stress and depressive symptoms. Resilience factors are differentially involved in protection against anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nConclusion Exposure to interpersonal stress is not only directly associated with depressive symptoms but also indirectly through high scores on anxiety symptoms. Uneven functioning and differential impact of resilience factors can help us understand the mixed successes in implementing resilience-based interventions for positive mental health and judiciously allocate scarce and finite resources for intervention.\nRead more"

    "text": "Imposition of lockdown restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was sudden and unprecedented and dramatically changed the life of many people, as they were confined to their homes with reduced movement and access to fitness training facilities. Studies have reported significant associations between physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and common mental health problems. This study investigated relations between participants’ reports of change in physical activity (PA; i.e., Reduced PA, Unchanged PA, or Increased PA) and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Norway in the time period from March 12, 2020 to June 15, 2020. The relations between age and gender and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms as well as how different levels of resilience influenced the relation between changes in PA and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms were also investigated. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants (N = 1,314; females = 31%) were members of an endurance sports organization aged between 18 and 81 years (M = 49 years; SD = 11.50 years). Participants completed the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported their changes in PA after lockdown restrictions were implemented on March 12, 2020. Regression analysis, independent samples t-test, and two-way multivariate analysis of variance were conducted. Reduced PA was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Younger participants in Reduced PA and Unchanged PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms and significantly higher on depression symptoms in Unchanged PA subgroup. Females in Unchanged PA and Increased PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms, whereas no gender differences were found for depression symptoms. The main and interaction effects of change in PA and resilience were significantly associated with depression symptoms. For anxiety symptoms, only the main effect of resilience, but not PA, and the interaction effect were significant. Results further showed that resilience was an important factor that influenced the levels of change in PA. High levels of resilience were associated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms in Reduced, Unchanged, and Increased PA subgroups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Promoting PA while boosting resilience factors such as confidence in own ability and drawing on the social support of even reduced social networks or connections while under lockdown can protect against common mental health problems.\nRead more"

Thematic analysis explored the factors that may affect the quality of working alliances within different subgroups.\nResults Three distinct trajectories of housing stability emerged (i.e., Class 1: “sharp rise, sustained, and decline housing”; Class 2: “hardly any time housed”; Class 3: “high rise, sustained, and decline housing”) with professional helping relationships having different effects in each. The analysis revealed structural and individual circumstances that may explain differences among the classes.\nConclusions The findings underscore the role of professional helping relationships, as distinct from services, in major interventions for highly disadvantaged populations, and draws new attention to the temporal patterns of responses to both the quality of relationship and targeted interventions.\nRead more"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives Sick leave due to anxiety and depression is a heterogeneous process constituting a pressing public health issue. This longitudinal study aimed to identify sick leave trajectories among patients before, during and after work-focused treatment, in all 29.5 months. We then aimed to determine the background and clinical characteristics of these trajectory groups.\nMethods Background and clinical data were collected by patient self-report (N=619) in an observational study in a specialised mental healthcare clinic. Sick leave was recorded from national registry data. A latent growth mixture model identified trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression determined differences in background characteristics while a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified clinical differences.\nResults We identified three trajectories: The ‘Resilient’ group (47.7%) had low sick leave throughout the period. The two other groups (‘Recovery’, 31.8% and ‘High risk’, 20.5%) had similar pretreatment trajectories: lower sick leave one year prior which increased to high sick leave at the start of treatment. After treatment, the ‘Recovery’ group made an almost full return to work while the ‘High risk’ group remained at high sick leave. The two groups with high sick leave had more women and higher age compared with the ‘Resilient’ group. All groups had similar clinical scores at the start of treatment, but the ‘High risk’ groups had residual depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. Effect sizes for anxiety and depression were moderate or large for all groups, (Cohen’s d=0.74–1.81), and 87.2% of the total sample were fully working one year after treatment.\nConclusion We found three subgroups with distinctly different trajectories. Female gender and higher age were associated with high sick leave at the start of treatment, while residual depressive symptoms at the end of treatment predicted continued sick leave. The study points to the possibility of improving patient outcomes in the future by stratifying and tailoring treatment to patient characteristics.\nRead here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cognitive models of social anxiety give prominence to dysfunctional schemas about the social self as the key underlying factors in maladaptive self-processing strategies and social anxiety symptoms. In contrast, the metacognitive model argues that beliefs about cognition represent a central belief domain underlying psychopathology and cognitive schemas as products of a thinking style regulated by metacognition. The present study therefore evaluated the temporal and reciprocal relations between metacognitive beliefs, social self-beliefs, and social anxiety symptoms to shed light on possible causal relationships among them. Eight hundred and sixty-eight individuals gathered at convenience participated in a four-wave online survey with each measurement wave 6 weeks apart. Using autoregressive cross-lagged panel models, we found significant temporal and reciprocal relations between metacognition, social self-beliefs (schemas), and social anxiety. Whilst social self-beliefs prospectively predicted social anxiety this relationship was reciprocal. Metacognitive beliefs prospectively predicted both social interaction anxiety and social self-beliefs, but this was not reciprocal. The results are consistent with metacognitive beliefs causing social anxiety and social self-beliefs and imply that negative social self-beliefs might be a product of metacognition. The clinical implications are that metacognitive beliefs should be the central target in treatments of social anxiety.\nRead more"

    "text": "Purpose The existing evidence suggests that a complete evaluation of mental health should incorporate both psychopathology and mental well-being indicators. However, few studies categorize European adolescents into subgroups based on such complete mental health data. This study used the data on mental well-being and symptoms of mental and behavioral disorders to explore the mental health profiles of adolescents in Europe.\nMethods Data collected from adolescents (N = 3767; mean age 12.4 [SD = 0.9]) from five European countries supplied the information on their mental well-being (personal resilience, school resilience, quality of life, and mental well-being) and mental and behavioral disorder symptoms (anxiety, depression, stress, bullying, cyber-bullying, and use of tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis). Multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis were combined to classify the youths into mental health profiles.\nResults Adolescents were categorized into three mental health profiles. The “poor mental health” profile (6%) was characterized by low levels of well-being and moderate symptoms of mental disorders. The “good mental health” profile group (26%) showed high well-being and few symptoms of mental disorders, and the “intermediate mental health” profile (68%) was characterized by average well-being and mild-to-moderate symptoms of mental disorders. Groups with higher levels of well-being and fewer symptoms of mental disorders showed lower rates of behavioral problems. Mental well-being indicators strongly contributed to this classification.\nConclusion Adolescents with the “intermediate” or “poor” mental health profiles may benefit from interventions to improve mental health. Implications for school-based interventions are discussed.\nRead more"

    "text": "Resilience is the process and outcome of healthy adaptation despite significant adversity. Proliferation of research on the resilience construct has led to scientific concerns about the operationalization and measurement of resilience for assessment science and practice. Various studies that have investigated the psychometric properties and construct validity of the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ) have yielded inconsistent findings, which could partly be due to variations in the methodological approaches. This study investigated the factor structure and construct validity of the READ in four European regions participating in the Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally Implemented in Schools to Improve and Promote Mental Health for Teenagers (UPRIGHT) project. Participants included adolescents aged 10–15 years from Spain (n = 391, females = 51%), Iceland (n = 379, females = 55%), Italy (n = 460, females = 55%), and Poland (n = 316, females = 51%). The five-factor model of the READ was similar across gender and participating regions. Construct validity of the READ was supported. After establishing construct separability, incremental validity was supported (except for the social competence subscale). The READ is a valid and reliable measure of protective factors involved in resilience and demonstrates promise for cross-cultural applicability. Recommendations for measuring resilience and validating the READ in future investigations are provided.\nRead more"

    "text": "To expand evidence for the nature and related mechanisms underlying loneliness measured by Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults (SELSA-S), several hypotheses were developed and tested to map the nomological network of loneliness. Tests included examining the structure of the multidimensional experiences of loneliness, concurrent and prospective relations between loneliness, sociodemographic variables, worry, rumination, metacognition, symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study also sought to determine how resilience is involved in the protection against loneliness and depressive symptoms. Four hundred and eighty-two students with a mean age of 25.84 years (SD = 5.74) participated (N = 482; 59% females). Structural and temporal stability analyses supported the multidimensional experiences of loneliness, including family, romantic and social loneliness. Psychological network analysis identified especially strong connections (i.e., edges) between indicators belonging to loneliness in family and social relationships. At the general level, older participants and those who were single reported more loneliness. Loneliness was concurrently and prospectively associated with worry, rumination and metacognitions and predicted vulnerabilities in levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. At follow-up, the effect of loneliness on depressive symptoms was lower when scoring high on resilience. Interventions for loneliness may address improving family relationships and metacognitive processes underlying loneliness, which may in turn improve mental health. Interpersonal and intrapersonal protective factors involved in resilience may compensate for deficits in social relationships thereby buffering negative effects of loneliness on common mental health problems.\nRead more"

The metacognitions questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30) is widely used to assess such metacognitions and to establish their effects. Previous studies consistently demonstrate that the MCQ-30 consists of five latent factors, with some factors showing wide-ranging positive associations with symptoms and some demonstrating more specific symptom links. Questions remain concerning relationships between MCQ-items (or domains) and the most central of these outside of the latent-factor model. In the present study we set out to explore the internal structure of the MCQ-30 using network analysis and estimated two graphical Gaussian models, one with items- and one with domains, in an unselected sample (N = 1080). The robustness and stability of the networks, as well as the node predictability were assessed. Among our observations was that the items of the MCQ-30 appeared to cluster in meaningful substructures, corresponding to metacognitive theory. Furthermore, “need for control” was the most centrally placed domain, suggesting it plays an important role in the network and that its activation has a strong influence on other nodes. The theoretical and clinical implications of the current findings are discussed in light of the metacognitive model of psychological disorder.\nRead more"

    "text": "There is increasing need to identify factors that contribute to poor work ability with an aim to prevent work related problems such as sick leave and disability pension. In the Metacognitive Control System model, dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs are seen as an underlying factor in psychological vulnerability beyond disorder, and recent studies have reported that metacognitions are associated with work ability and work status. In the present study, we set out to test if there is a prospective relationship between dysfunctional metacognitions and self-assessed work ability. Individuals in working age (M = 37.19; SD = 10.31) participated in a four-timepoint self-report survey (N = 528; 75% females) separated by six weeks between each timepoint. Baseline gender differences and differences between participants by job status were conducted using t-test and one-way ANOVA, respectively. Latent growth curve with covariates assessed the impact of dysfunctional metacognitions on work ability across the four timepoints. Males reported higher work ability. Participants in fulltime job also reported higher work ability followed by those in part-time job, jobseekers, sick leave up to 12 months, and sick leave > 12 months, respectively. Dysfunctional metacognitions predicted work ability over time when controlling for gender, age, physical health status, and three common categories of emotional distress symptoms. This finding suggest that dysfunctional metacognitions are a prospective predictor of work ability beyond health status and implies that these beliefs should be targeted with a view to increasing work ability and thus potentially reduce risk for sick leave and other work-related problems.\nRead more"

We tested the role of two suggested underlying factors in GAD, interpersonal problems and negative metacognitive beliefs, as predictors of trait-worry and trait-anxiety.\nMethods The sample consisted of 56 patients with a primary diagnosis of GAD from a randomized controlled trial. We first estimated the proportion of variance lying between the higher level of the data structure to account for potential therapists’ effects. Two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted testing change in interpersonal problems and negative metacognitive beliefs as predictors of change in trait-worry and trait-anxiety following treatment. Change in depression and anxiety symptoms was controlled.\nResults Change in negative metacognitive beliefs was the strongest predictor of improvement of both trait-worry and trait-anxiety. Change in interpersonal problems was not a unique predictor of change in trait-worry but did make a significant and unique contribution to trait-anxiety.\nConclusions Negative metacognitive beliefs may be important targets to improve trait-worry and trait-anxiety in GAD. Interpersonal problems may be relevant for trait-anxiety but could also be a surface marker of higher order vulnerability factors. Implications for treatment are discussed.\nRead more"

This study aimed to validate the validity and psychometric properties of the resilience scale for adults in a sample of long-term sick-listed individuals, and to investigate measurement invariance when compared with a university student sample. Confirmatory factor analysis was used on a sick-listed sample (n = 687) to identify the scale?s factor structure, and comparison with a university student sample (n = 241) was utilized to determine measurement invariance. Results show that a slightly modified factor structure, in accordance with previous research, achieved acceptable fit in the sick-listed sample, while comparisons with the student sample supported measurement invariance. This means that the study to a large degree support the factor structure of the resilience scale for adults in long-term sick-listed. Furthermore, the results indicate that the scale is similarly understood among long-term sick-listed as in a previously validated student sample. Thus, the resilience scale for adults can be a valid and reliable measure of protective factors in the long-term sickness absence and return to work context, and the subscale and total score can be interpreted similarly in long-term sick-listed as in other populations.\nRead more"

    "text": "The metacognitive model of psychological disorders suggests that emotional disorders are related to maladaptive metacognitive strategies corresponding to underlying dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs. There is substantial empirical evidence supporting a role of metacognition in psychopathology, but fewer studies have evaluated the metacognitive model using longitudinal data and taken into consideration its differentiation between components and how they are hypothesized to be related to each other. Thus, more specific model evaluation is important as it relates to identifying mechanisms of disorder with a potential to provide clinical advances. In the present study, 868 participants took part in a 4-wave survey and reported on metacognitive beliefs and strategies and anxiety symptoms. Two longitudinal mediation models (forward and reversed causation) were run to test temporal precedence and bidirectional relations. The results indicated that metacognitive beliefs significantly predicted metacognitive strategies, which further predicted anxiety symptoms and mediated the indirect effect in the relationship between metacognitive beliefs and anxiety over time. The relationship between metacognitive beliefs and anxiety symptoms over time were bidirectional, but this relationship was not accounted for by metacognitive strategies. These findings largely support central predictions set forward by the metacognitive model and indicate that metacognitions play a preceding and maintaining role in anxiety.\nRead more"

In the current study, our three objectives were to evaluate and replicate the network structure of dysfunctional metacognitions as assessed with the MCQ-30, to examine its stability when adding relevant covariates in the form of metacognitive strategies (worry and rumination) and symptoms (anxiety and depression), and to evaluate how different sets of dysfunctional metacognitions are more or less strongly linked differently to metacognitive strategies and symptoms. A cross-sectional university sample with a mean age of 26 years (N = 440; Males = 156, Females = 283) completed the Metacognitions Questionnaire–30, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Ruminative Response Scale, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Data were analysed using psychological network analysis in R-studio statistical software. The network structure of dysfunctional metacognitions replicated well with item clusters that correspond to clinically meaningful substructures in the metacognitive model. Negative metacognitive beliefs and beliefs about uncontrollability might have more functional significance in the mutual connections between dysfunctional meta-domains as well as the connections with metacognitive strategies and symptoms. For worry and anxiety, negative beliefs about uncontrollability and corresponding danger of worry were more prominently connected in the network structure. For rumination, cognitive self-consciousness was more prominent, whereas for depression, need for control was more prominently connected. Support was found for mutual interdependence between different sets of dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs, that metacognitive beliefs are linked to but separate from metacognitive strategies, and that these may function together in affecting emotional distress symptoms.\nRead more"

We calculated incidence and cumulative incidence for each cluster, disaggregated by gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Poisson regression analyses were performed.\nResults Overall, 9,486,853 person-years of observation were available for the 609,281 individuals included. ADHD and conduct disorders were diagnosed in the first decade, anxiety and depression disorders in the second and third decades, and psychosis/personality and substance use in the third. The cumulative incidence at 18 years of age for any type of disorder was 15.5%. The group with low SES had a statistically significantly higher incidence of all eight clusters. The incidence of ADHD, conduct disorders, depression, psychosis/personality disorders, and substance use was higher in males and that of anxiety, eating disorders and self-harm was higher in females.\nConclusions The incidence of mental disorders is high among children, adolescents, and young adults in the Basque Country underlining the need for preventive interventions.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Researchers start their research by creating a null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no difference or relationship between the variables being tested. They then collect data and use statistical tests to determine if the data is consistent with the null hypothesis (i.e., retain the null hypothesis), or if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Formally approaching the decision to retain or reject the null hypothesis is called Null Hypothesis Testing.\nA researcher may select a sample of 750 students from the population of all NTNU students to investigate the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety. Ideally, the researcher wants to make conclusions about the population of all NTNU students using sample statistics which is computed based on the sample of 750 students. A sample statistic is a numerical summary from the sample data. Here, the mean of exam anxiety for the 750 students or the correlation between attending lectures and exam anxiety for the 750 students is a sample statistic. Its corresponding numeric value for all NTNU students is called a parameter (or population parameter). Although the researcher works with a sample of 750 students, the ultimate interest is in the population of all NTNU students. But the parameter value is unknown unless the researcher can gather all NTNU students.\nSo, what does the researcher do?\nThe researcher uses sample statistics as estimates for the corresponding population parameters. But this has some problems due to sampling error or random variability. This happens because whenever the researcher samples different groups of 750 students, the researcher may observe a mean of 4.50 for exam anxiety in Group 1 and 5.20 in Group 2 and yet still 3.75 in Group 3. This random variability in a sample statistic such as the mean of exam anxiety from sample to sample is called sampling error.\nSo, what does this mean for the researcher´s conclusions?\nIf the researcher makes conclusions based on the sample of 750 students, it will not be guaranteed that the conclusion will be observed in the population of all NTNU students as we have seen with sampling error. It could be that the mean of exam anxiety is not even close to any of the sample means and it could also be that the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety observed in the sample of 750 students, will not exist and that there will be no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety at all in the population, which means that the observed relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in the sample of 750 students is just due to sampling error or occurred by chance.\nSo, null hypothesis testing is a statistical technique used to determine if the results of a study occurred by chance, or if they are a true effect in the population.\nThere are many different ways to decide between retaining or rejecting the null hypothesis, but the general idea is based on the observed relationship in the sample, based on which the researcher makes inferences to the population. Consequently, the general idea is that:\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects sampling error or very likely occurred by chance. Thus, no true effect or relationship exists in the population.\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects a true effect or relationship in the population. Thus, it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\n\nLet’s say that a researcher starts with a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety, and collects data from 750 students of NTNU. The researcher must first choose a level of significance (such as 0.05) that represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. If the p-value is less than the level of significance, the researcher can conclude that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For example, if a correlation test shows a very low p-value, say p < 0.05, this means that it is extremely or very unlikely that the results of the correlation test occurred by chance if the null hypothesis was true.\nSince the p-value, or the probability of observing the results given the null hypothesis, is less than the significance level, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, which states that there is a significant relationship or effect between the variables being tested - that is, the observed relationship in the sample data reflects true effect or relationship in the population. So, there is a signifcant relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in NTNU students.\nRejecting the null hypothesis doesn’t necessarily prove that the alternative hypothesis is true. It simply means that based on the available evidence, it is more likely that there is a relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety than that there isn’t. The decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on several factors, including the significance level, or alpha, which specifies the maximum probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis if it is actually true in the population.\nIn the next post, I will tell you the importance of null hypothesis testing for making predictions about the population using sample data (i.e., statistics)."
