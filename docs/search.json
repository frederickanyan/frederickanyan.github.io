    "text": "My teaching in undergraduate quantitative method course focuses on understanding and emphasizing statistical concepts and their applications more than mathematics, computational details and theoretical derivatives in the statistical methodology. Occasionally, and depending on context and need, my teaching in advanced and graduate-level quantitative method will add computational and statistical details to understanding concepts and their applications.\nMy research focuses on the application and assessment of quantitative methods in the social and behavioural sciences. Specifically, I focus on combining innovative statistical methods and substantive interests into a single program of research that seeks to understand, improve and promote adaptive psychological functioning and resilience in the following areas:\nLongitudinal analyses of the mental health, vulnerability and protective factors among Norwegian Afghanistan veterans. Investigating what factors contribute to the complex interplay between biological systems, psychological and social-environmental factors in perpetuating the feeling of loneliness and social isolation and the consequences for mental and physical health outcomes. Investigating how individuals recruit multiple protective systems (biological, psychological, social-environmental, community, and ecological factors) to respond to adversity. Investigating the central mechanisms (beliefs, awareness, strategies, and executive functioning) in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders and important targets in treatments inspired by the Metacognitive Control System Model\nMy expertise in applied analysis in panel and intensive longitudinal data, as well as structural equation modelling (SEM) and hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) enables my participation in research to uncover subtle patterns in complex data sets, teasing apart minute details to reveal crucial insights that could inform effective interventions.\nBeyond research, I am very approachable and a passionate mentor and educator, with a deep commitment to sharing my expertise, taking active role in training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. With a diverse quantitative and substantive research program that influences both theory and practice, I strive not only to make meaningful contributions to the scientific community through teaching and research, but also, train the next generation of researchers. So, you are welcome to contact me."

If one identifies this subgroup and connects data from HUNT with the Armed Forces’ health surveys, this will provide a unique opportunity to find links between risk factors (lifestyle or environment) and the development of good or bad health (illness) after international deployments, and also to understand how resilience and constellations of specific robustness factors might differ in a civilian and veteran sample."

    "text": "Researchers start their research by creating a null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no difference or relationship between the variables being tested. They then collect data and use statistical tests to determine if the data is consistent with the null hypothesis (i.e., retain the null hypothesis), or if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Formally approaching the decision to retain or reject the null hypothesis is called Null Hypothesis Testing.\nA researcher may select a sample of 750 students from the population of all NTNU students to investigate the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety. Ideally, the researcher wants to make conclusions about the population of all NTNU students using sample statistics which is computed based on the sample of 750 students. A sample statistic is a numerical summary from the sample data. Here, the mean of exam anxiety for the 750 students or the correlation between attending lectures and exam anxiety for the 750 students is a sample statistic. Its corresponding numeric value for all NTNU students is called a parameter (or population parameter). Although the researcher works with a sample of 750 students, the ultimate interest is in the population of all NTNU students. But the parameter value is unknown unless the researcher can gather all NTNU students.\nSo, what does the researcher do?\nThe researcher uses sample statistics as estimates for the corresponding population parameters. But this has some problems due to sampling error or random variability. This happens because whenever the researcher samples different groups of 750 students, the researcher may observe a mean of 4.50 for exam anxiety in Group 1 and 5.20 in Group 2 and yet still 3.75 in Group 3. This random variability in a sample statistic such as the mean of exam anxiety from sample to sample is called sampling error.\nSo, what does this mean for the researcher´s conclusions?\nIf the researcher makes conclusions based on the sample of 750 students, it will not be guaranteed that the conclusion will be observed in the population of all NTNU students as we have seen with sampling error. It could be that the mean of exam anxiety is not even close to any of the sample means and it could also be that the relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety observed in the sample of 750 students, will not exist and that there will be no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety at all in the population, which means that the observed relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in the sample of 750 students is just due to sampling error or occurred by chance.\nSo, null hypothesis testing is a statistical technique used to determine if the results of a study occurred by chance, or if they are a true effect in the population.\nThere are many different ways to decide between retaining or rejecting the null hypothesis, but the general idea is based on the observed relationship in the sample, based on which the researcher makes inferences to the population. Consequently, the general idea is that:\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects sampling error or very likely occurred by chance. Thus, no true effect or relationship exists in the population.\n\n\nThe observed effect or relationship in the sample data reflects a true effect or relationship in the population. Thus, it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\n\nLet’s say that a researcher starts with a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety, and collects data from 750 students of NTNU. The researcher must first choose a level of significance (such as 0.05) that represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. If the p-value is less than the level of significance, the researcher can conclude that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For example, if a correlation test shows a very low p-value, say p < 0.05, this means that it is extremely or very unlikely that the results of the correlation test occurred by chance if the null hypothesis was true.\nSince the p-value, or the probability of observing the results given the null hypothesis, is less than the significance level, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, which states that there is a significant relationship or effect between the variables being tested - that is, the observed relationship in the sample data reflects true effect or relationship in the population. So, there is a signifcant relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety in NTNU students.\nRejecting the null hypothesis doesn’t necessarily prove that the alternative hypothesis is true. It simply means that based on the available evidence, it is more likely that there is a relationship between attending lectures and exam anxiety than that there isn’t. The decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on several factors, including the significance level, or alpha, which specifies the maximum probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis if it is actually true in the population.\nIn the next post, I will tell you the importance of null hypothesis testing for making predictions about the population using sample data (i.e., statistics)."

    "text": "Rejecting the null hypothesis is useful for making inferences about the sample and the population because it allows the researcher to draw conclusions about whether or not there is a statistically significant effect, difference or relationship between variables.\nResearchers start their research by creating a null hypothesis, which is typically the assumption that there is no significant effect, difference or relationship between the variables.

Being able to make inferences about the population, even if the researcher only has data from a sample of that population, is because the researcher has determined that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance (through null hypothesis testing - see the previous post), and so the results are representative of the population as a whole. If you have read the previous post, you would know sampling error or random variability poses a problem to this claim"
